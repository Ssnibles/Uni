## Gartner hype cycle

1. **Technology Trigger**
    A potential technology breakthrough kicks things off.
    Early proof-of-concept stories and media interest trigger significant publicity.
    Often no usable products exist and commercial viability is unproven.

2. **Peak of inflated Expectations**
    Early publicity produces a number of success storiesâ€”often accompanied by scores of failures.
    Some companies take action; most do not.

3. **Through of disillusionment**
    Interest wanes as experiments and implementations fail to deliver.
    Producers of the technology shake out or fail.
    Investment continues only if the surviving providers improve their products to the satisfaction of early adopters.

4. **Slope of enlightenment**
    More instances of the technology's benefits start to crystallize and become more widely understood.
    Second- and third-generation products appear from technology providers.
    More enterprises fund pilots; conservative companies remain cautious.

5. **Plateu of productivity**
    Mainstream adoption starts to take off.
    Criteria for assessing provider viability are more clearly defined.
    The technology's broad market applicability and relevance are clearly paying off.
    If the technology has more than a niche market, then it will continue to grow.

## Limitations & Criticism of the Gartner Hype Cycles

- Not scientific - not grounded in data or analysis
- The labels are subjective, misleading, and do not accurately describe the  current position of the tech
- No prediction perspective is offered to move technology to the next phase
- Analysis of hype cycles since 2000 shows few tech travels through an identifiable cycles
- The most important tech since 2000 were no identified early in their adoption cycles
- it is not a life cycle, but rather it reflects the hype about something

# Blockchain

> [!NOTE]
> Things on the blockchain can only be put together into
> one understandable bit of data when they are *chained*  together.
> When one block is chained, the entire chain following be invalid

# Web3

Web 3 promises:

- A version of the www based on decentralized public Blockchains
- More control and ownership to users of the web
- Give users ownership of their data and to decide how it is used
- Take ownership of personal data away from corporations
