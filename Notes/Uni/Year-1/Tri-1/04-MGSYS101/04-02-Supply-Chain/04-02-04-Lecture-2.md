# Internal and external integration

External integration is integration of services which are not part of your company, such as materials sourcing, delivery, etc
Whereas internal integration of services uses Services from whitin the company

## Dell case study

Dell shares information with their suppliers

Dells supply chain is external integration

### Dells supply chain

Just-in-time deliveries -> Dell -> Made to order (customers)

This means that Dell does not have any finished orders, nor do they store components.
Using JIT deliveries means that there is no need for expensive storgae facilities.

> [!NOTE]
> The benefits of this is that, since they are made to order, customisation is a huge up-side.
> The computers they sell are exactly the way which the customers want them.
>
> Faster deliveries due to this (usually in a couple of days)
>
> No Inventory for parts
>
> There is also less risk of product obsolesence

# Integrated transport - Multimodal transport

- Multimodal: the use of multiple ways of transport, such as ships, trains, planes etc
- Facilitatd by the development of transport unitisation
  - The packaging of small items into standard pallet siszed loads
  - Unit loads can be handled by mechanaical equipment and moved between transport modes without handling each item on its own
  - Supports efficient transport flows and the reduction of delivery times

Rail -> [Handling] -> Ship -> [Handling] -> Truck
