# Flow of supply chain

Supplier -> Distributor -> Retailer -> Consumer

> [!NOTE]
> The above pictures the flow of information

## Information

- Purchase order
- Urgency of orders
- Availability of inventory
- Delivery information
- Customer demand

## Chocolate supply chain

Farmer -> Cooperative -> Coco Processer -> Chocolate manufacturer -> Distributor -> Retailer -> Consumer

> "An interlinked chain of processses which transform materials into prodocuts"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Three flows are needed to manufacturer something:
>
> - Flow of Material (Physical things used in the production e.g. fabrics)
> - Cash (The money needed to complete the process, such as labour, and the materials)
> - Information

# Supply chains then

- In early societies, produces such as farmers would sell their wares at the local market
  - Now with international trade, its much harder to gain feedback
  - The lack of no direct communication can be a huge downfall
  - The demand for new, and high quality goods has increased as global trade did
  - Focus on competencies (!= vertical integration)
  (Vertical intefration: total control on the whole supply chain)

Todays companies have a focus on a single form of product (clothing, cars, electronics etc)

# General supply chain

Material Supplier -> Tier 2 Suppliers -> Tier 1 Suppliers -> Manufacturer -> Dealers -> Consumers

> [!NOTE]
> In a supply chain, the chain is only as strong as its weakest link, and if one link falls out
> the entire chain breaks
>
> Its not a chain in the sense that it is non linear, having many branches from the main chain

# Why is supply chain management needed

- Competetive advantage
  - Cost advantage
  - Value advantage (differential)

> [!info]
> A product needs to be cheap to produce, and profitable to sell.
> They need to provide a higher value and / or lower price for customers to consider the process Valuable.
> Supply chain management is a way to ensure that the cost is put into parts that matter.

1. ***inventory:***  An understanding of the current market is needed for efficient supply chain management.
For instance, if some product is going out of fashion, the prodction and inventory for that item
can be reduced, saving cost.

2. ***Making goods move faster:*** This step reduces the waiting time, not just for consumers, but also
for materials needed in production, which drives up efficiency.

3. ***Streamlining the chain:*** By automating steps of the chain, a lower cost can be achieved.

# Cost vs Value advantage

People decide on what to buy based on many things:

- Features and quality
- Higher level of service (e.g. fast deliveries)
- Brand
- Product variety and customisation
- etc
