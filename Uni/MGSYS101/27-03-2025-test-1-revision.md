    > "The Number of transisters in a per square inch on an 
    > intergrated chip doubles about every two years" - Moore
    
    - More transisters means the performance will double about every two years

   - Exponentially improved performance and efficiency
   - Reduces the size of the device
   - Reduces the cost of manu
