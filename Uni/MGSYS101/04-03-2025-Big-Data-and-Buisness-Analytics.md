## Big Data and Business Analytics

### How Do We Make Decisions

- Use data to determine the best outcome

## What is Data? What is Information?

- Data is raw process information
- Information is the processed data giving context to the data

## Flow of Data

Data > information > knowledge > wisdom

## What is Good Information

- Produced in a timely manner
- Is relevant to its purpose
- Is accurate for its purpose
- Complete enough for the problem
- Reliable and targeted to the right person to be used correctly
- Worth the cost (e.g. time and money)

## Principles for Safe and effective Usage of Data and Analytics

1. Deliver clear public benefit
2. Ensure data is fit for its purpose
3. Focuses on people
4. Maintain transparency
5. Understand the limitations
6. Retain human oversight

## What is Big Data

"big data is high volume, high velocity and high variety information assets that demand cost-effective innovative

Forms of information processing that enable enhanced insight, decision making and processes Automation"

> [!NOTE]
> Volume, velocity, variety

When all three are applicable to a set of data, it is considered as big data

Big data required specialized tools to deal with the data, in many cases, the scale of the data may serve as a problem

### Volume

> [!NOTE]
> Volume is about the size or scale of the data

- Humans generate a large amount of data daily
- Growing more and more each day

### Velocity

> [!NOTE]
> Data needs to be analyzed quickly

- Data can be outdated fast, thus the newest data is always needed
- Data needs to be processed in real time to reap the most rewards from it

### Variety

> [!NOTE]
> Data has a large variety of structured and unstructured data

- However the primary concern with data is not the scale of it, but the lack of structure of it
  Most data is not neatly organized into spreadsheets
- Big data is a mix of structured and unstructured data

## Where Does the Data come From?

Data comes from everywhere

- Weblogs, RFID, GPS, healthcare, military, shopping etc

### What is the Future of Healthcare

- Using big data to detect potential health risks before they even happen

| Benefits                           | Negatives                                   |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| preventative                       | reactive                                    |
| reduced infrastructure cost        | privacy concerns                            |
| reduced deaths                     | accessibility to the technology             |
| fever cases of preventable diseases | less personal responsibility for own health |
| less strain on healthcare service  | dependence on this technology               |
|                                    | ethical questions                           |

Using big data to integrate things such as this into your life counts as a digital twin

A digital twin acts as a digital copy of you which can be used by data scientists

> "Without data you're just another person with an opinion" - Edwards Deming

The above quote states that without concrete information, data with a context, acting is idiotic

## Big Data Can Be Used to Determine the Optimal Outcome Based on a given Problem

- How to launch a new product, its reception in the public
- Google Maps taking the optimal path based on current conditions (weather, traffic etc.)

## What to Do with the Data

- Descriptive

  > explain what happened

- Diagnostic

  > explain why it happened

- Predictive

  > forecast what might happen

- Prescriptive

  > recommend an action based on the forecast

## For Instance

People purchase a product during the holiday times, Christmas.
It is also found out that the end users are usually between the ages of 8 to 18 and the buyers are between the ages of 35 to 55
From this data, it can be concluded that parents buy the item for their kids as a Christmas present
Based on this info, the product can be marketed to parents and kids separately and more money can be put into advertising during the holiday months
