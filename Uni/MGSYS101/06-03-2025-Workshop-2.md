> How is Amazon using big data analytics?

In the reading:
Response A is the most verbose and rambled about unimportant topics, furthermore, the response A seems to not be sure about most topics covered.

In Response B, the writer does not carry on too long and is cons ice and to the point. This makes it the best out of all of them.

Response C on the other hand is too short and seems to simplify the topic at hand. Due to this, it is the second worst one out of all the responses.

## Predictive analytics

This process is used to predict future outcomes based on historical data.
This process uses multiple models to predict what might happen in the future, this is often used for things such as meteorology, and weather prediction.
It's also used in many other fields such as spam detection, engineering, etc.

- Acquiring data
- Being careful with what data to use
- Being sure of what the model will do
